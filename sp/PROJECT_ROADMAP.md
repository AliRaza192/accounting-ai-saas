# AccountingAI Pro - Project Roadmap

## Overview
This roadmap outlines the development phases for AccountingAI Pro, an enterprise-grade AI SaaS accounting software built using Spec-Driven Development (SDD) methodology.

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation & Core Architecture (Months 1-2)
- Complete functional and technical specifications
- Establish security and compliance frameworks
- Set up core infrastructure and database schemas
- Develop initial API specifications
- Create foundational AI agent specifications

### Phase 2: Core Features & AI Integration (Months 3-4)
- Implement core accounting functionalities
- Integrate AI agents for automated bookkeeping
- Develop data processing and analysis modules
- Complete performance specifications and benchmarks
- Implement integration specifications for key partners

### Phase 3: UI/UX & User Experience (Months 5-6)
- Complete UI specifications and design system
- Implement responsive frontend components
- Conduct usability testing based on testing specifications
- Optimize performance based on established benchmarks
- Refine AI interactions and prompts

### Phase 4: Integration & Testing (Months 7-8)
- Complete all third-party integrations
- Execute comprehensive testing based on specifications
- Perform security audits and compliance verification
- Optimize error handling and resilience
- Conduct performance tuning

### Phase 5: Deployment & Optimization (Months 9-10)
- Deploy to production environment
- Monitor performance against established benchmarks
- Gather user feedback and iterate
- Optimize AI models based on usage data
- Prepare for scale and enterprise deployment

## Dependencies Between Specifications

### Critical Path Dependencies
1. **Functional → Technical**: Functional requirements drive technical architecture decisions
2. **Security → All Others**: Security specifications must be considered in all other areas
3. **Data → API**: Data models must be defined before API contracts
4. **UI → Integration**: UI specifications may influence integration requirements
5. **Performance → Technical**: Performance requirements impact technical implementation choices

### Parallel Development Opportunities
- AI and backend development can proceed in parallel after initial specifications
- Frontend development can begin once UI specifications are stable
- Testing can start early with unit tests, expanding to integration tests
- Infrastructure can be provisioned in parallel with application development

## Estimated Timeline
- Total Duration: 10 months
- Buffer Time: 2 weeks allocated between major phases for unexpected delays
- Milestone Reviews: Scheduled at the end of each phase
- Risk Mitigation: Monthly risk assessments and contingency planning
